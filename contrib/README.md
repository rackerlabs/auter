# Auter contrib directory

This directory contains useful scripts, config files and/or cron schedules which can be used as examples for more complex and interesting implementations of auter as well as useful scripts which are specifically created for the the auter pre/post functions.

# Guidelines
- This collection of scripts should be generic enough to be used on any server or environment.
- A new directory should be created for each new purpose
- In each directory there MUST be a README.md file created with the layout provided below
- If there are any prerequisites or configuration requirements or options for the scripts to work, they should be documented in the README.md
- Scripts should be explicitly include the interpreter line ie: #!/bin/sh or #!/usr/bin/python
- Scripts should be set as executable before uploading
- Scripts MUST return an exit code of 0 for a successful run. Any exceptions will cause auter to fail
- Script names should be either a brief description or the package that is being called. The script name should also have a "-phase" suffix. Note that the interpreter suffix is not required but may be useful ie:
  - notifyAvailablePatches-post-prep
  - configsnap.pre-apply
  - removeFromAppPool.pre-reboot
  - appStartConfirmation.post-reboot.sh
