# Auter contrib directory

This directory contains useful scripts, config files and/or cron schedules which can be used as examples for more complex and interesting implementations of auter as well as useful scripts which are specifically created for the the auter pre/post functions.

# Guidelines
- This collection of scripts should be generic enough to be used on any server or environment.
- A new directory should be created for each new purpose
- In each directory there MUST be a README.md file created with the layout provided below
- If there are any prerequisites or configuration requirements or options for the scripts to work, they should be documented in the README.md
- Scripts should be explicitly include the interpreter line ie: #!/bin/sh or #!/usr/bin/python
- Scripts should be set as executable before uploading
- Scripts MUST return an exit code of 0 for a successful run. Any exceptions will cause auter to fail
- Script names should be either a brief description or the package that is being called. The script name should also reference the intended phase in the filename. Note that the interpreter suffix is not required but may be useful ie:
  - notifyAvailablePatches-post-prep
  - configsnap.pre-apply
  - removeFromAppPool.pre-reboot
  - appStartConfirmation.post-reboot.sh
- It is also recommended that script names follow the xx-filename (where xx are padded digits) naming convention to ensure correct script execution order. See the man page for more information.
